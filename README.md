Welcome to my GitHub Page! :wave:, below is a brief summary

### Research Project
- [Celebrity_Network_2009-2019](https://github.com/xz2623/Celebrity_Network_2009-2019): This folder contains scripts I coded for empirical research on the Chinese movie market :movie_camera: through the lens of social influence.
- ***Data_Cleaning.ipynb***: Web-scraped and preprocessed 2,200+ demographic records from Baidu Encyclopedia
- ***Individual & Aggregated Network Build.ipynb***: Constructed large-scale celebrity networks (5,856 nodes, 2009–2019) applying adjacency rules based on collaboration, education, kinship, and birthplace, and applied network analysis techniques to compute centrality measures (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector)

### Group Project: Industry
- [customer_recovery](https://github.com/xz2623/customer_recovery): contains the deliverables(code) for Jetta, :car: a sub-brand of Volkswagen, where we, as data analysis consultants, were hired to reacquire customers who have visited physical stores but haven't made a purchase by in-depth data analyses and machine learning solutions.
- Conducted data pre-processing and exploratory data analysis on available customer data, including
	- activities at the physical stores, test driving, conversation topics, expressed interests, etc.
 	- behaviors on a Chinese automobile community app, including surveys, favorite lists, etc. 
- aggregated the data at the level of each visitor and built a viable ML model that predicts how likely each customer is to be re-acquired.

### Academic Group Project in my Master's program of Data Analytics & Business Computing: 
- [AB_Testing---MSDABC](https://github.com/xz2623/AB_Testing---MSDABC): serves as a delivery folder for my Marketing Analytics course, group deliverables(codes only) including assignment of A/B testing, customer attribution and allocation, customer segmentation, and customer churn and CLV.

- [Network_Analytics_DABC](https://github.com/xz2623/Network_Analytics_DABC): This repo serves as a delivery folder for my Network Analytics course, group deliverable(code only) including a Travel Recommender system using Community detection:
	- Web scraped users' posts, reviews, and hashtags from Twitter on travelling destinations in Python, amounting to 30,000 data points.
 	- Constructed the adjacency matrix and user similarity network with Jaccard Index, detected and labeled 5 homophily communities in a divisive algorithm, and built bipartite graphs to identify destinations with higher in-degree centrality as customized travelling lists. The final recommendation system improves the scenic spots’ matching accuracy by 15%.
