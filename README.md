# Summary
Welcome to my GitHub Page!

### Group Project
- [customer_recovery](https://github.com/xz2623/customer_recovery): This folder contains the deliverables(code) for Jetta, a separate sub-brand of the Volkswagen Group, where we attempted to reacquire customers who have visited physical stores but haven't made a purchase by in-depth data analyses and machine learning solutions.
- Conducted data cleaning and preparation, and exploratory data analysis on available customer data provided by our vendors, including
	- customer data of activities at the physical stores, test driving, conversation topics, expressed interests, etc.
 	- customer data of behaviors on a Chinese automobile community app, including surveys, favorite lists, etc. 
- aggregated the data at the level of each visitor and built a viable ML model that predicts how likely each customer is to be re-acquired.
